### Motivation
This was the term project for our course "Cs308 - Software Engineering". The main aim of this group project was to develop a "database-driven web application". We followed the regulations and requirements based on the course and our instructor Anıl Koyuncu.

### Methodology
We followed the agile software development throughout this project. A teaching assistant (Genco Coşgun) was assigned to the team as the "client". We held regular Scrum Meetings to follow each other's progress inside the team and weekly client meetings to present our development and get feedback. The project was divided into 5 sprints. The first 4 of them were 4-weeks long and the last one was an "extra" sprint that lasted for one week. At the end of each sprint, we had sprint demos with the teaching assistant and the instructor.

### Technologies
* Frontend                    -->   Flutter
* Backend                     -->   Django
* Database                    -->   sqlite3
* Tracking the sprint tasks   -->   Jira Software
* Storing the code            -->   Bitbucket

### Collaboration
This was a group project. We had 3 members. Although we were aware of the 'big picture', as we were using some technologies that we've no experience with before, we tried to divide them to focus more and master them. I was mainly responsible for the backend, coding the views, and configuring the URLs in Django.

### Commits
Throughout the semester we worked on the project on our private Bitbucket repository and when it was finished and graded, I decided to add it to my Github profile. That's why it consists of the initial commit only.
